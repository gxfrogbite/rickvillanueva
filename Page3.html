<center><i><p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Intro:</p></i>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Well, when you go<br>
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay<br>
And maybe when you get back<br>
I'll be off to find another way<br>
</p>
<br>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">And after all this time that you still owe<br>
You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know<br>
So take your gloves and get out<br>
Better get out while you can<br>
</p>
<br>
<i><p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Chorus:</p></i>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">When you go, and would you even turn to say<br>
I don't love you like I did yesterday<br>
</p>
<br>
<i><p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Verse 2</p></i>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading<br>
So sick and tired of all the needless beating<br>
But baby, when they knock you down and out<br>
Is where you ought to stay<br>
<br>
And after all the blood that you still owe<br>
Another dollar's just another blow<br>
So fix your eyes and get up<br>
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
<br>
When you go, and would you even turn to say<br>
I don't love you like I did yesterday<br>
<br>
Well, come on, come on!<br>
<br>
When you go, would you have the guts to say<br>
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday<br>
<br>
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday<br>
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
