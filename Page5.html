<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Say baby, say baby, say baby<br>
<br>
What you doin'? (What you doin'?)<br>
Where you at? (Where you at?)<br>
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?)<br>
Don't say that (Shut yo' trap)<br>
<br>
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip)<br>
In a robe (Drip, drip)<br>
I look too good (Look too good)<br>
To be alone (Woohoo)<br>
<br>
My house clean, uh (House clean)<br>
My pool warm (Pool warm)<br>
Just shaved (Smooth like a newborn)<br>
<br>
We should be dancing, romancing, in the east wing<br>
And the west wing of this mansion, what's happenin'?<br>
<br>
I ain't playin' no games, every word<br>
That I say is coming straight from the heart, uh<br>
So if you tryna lay in these arms<br>
<br>
I'ma leave the door open<br>
(I'ma leave the door open)<br>
I'ma leave the door open, girl<br>
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')<br>
<br>
That you feel the way I feel<br>
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby<br>
Tell me that you're coming through<br>
<br>
Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet)<br>
So tight (So tight)<br>
I won't bite (Uh-huh)<br>
Unless you like (Unless you like)<br>
<br>
If you smoke (What you smoke?)<br>
I got the haze (Purple haze)<br>
And if you're hungry, girl I got filets (Wohoo)<br>
<br>
Ooh baby, don't keep me (Waiting)<br>
There's so much love we could be making (Shamon)<br>
<br>
I'm talking kissing<br>
Cuddling<br>
Rose petals in the bathtub, girl lets jump in<br>
It's bubblin'<br>
<br>
I ain't playin no games, every word<br>
That I say is coming straight from the heart, uh<br>
So<br>
(If you tryna lay in these arms)<br>
If ya'<br>
Tryna<br>
Lay in these arms<br>
<br>
I'ma leave the door open<br>
(I'ma leave the door open)<br>
I'ma leave the door open, girl<br>
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')<br>
Ooh-ooh<br>
<br>
That you feel the way I feel<br>
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby<br>
Tell me that you're coming through<br>
(C'mon girl)<br>
<br>
La, la, la, la-la-la-la<br>
I need you baby<br>
<br>
La, la, la, la-la-la-la<br>
I got to see you baby<br>
<br>
La, la, la, la-la-la-la<br>
Girl, I'm tryna give you this<br>
Ah<br>

Hey, hey<br>

I'ma leave my door open, girl<br>
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')<br>
And I'm hopin'<br>
<br>
Hopin', that you feel the way I feel<br>
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby<br>
Tell me that you're coming through, woo<br>
