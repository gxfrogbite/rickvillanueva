<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">It's hard to wake up<br>
When the shades have been pulled shut<br>
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic<br>
It makes no sense at all<br>
I'm ripe with things to say<br>
The words rot and fall away<br>
What stupid poem could fix this home?<br>
I'd read it every day<br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms"><i>[Chorus: Tom DeLonge:]</i></p>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">So here's your holiday<br>
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away<br>
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone<br>
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?<br>
<br>
It's not right<br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms"><i>[Mark Hoppus:]</i></p>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">Their anger hurts my ears<br>
Been running strong for seven years<br>
Rather than fix the problems<br>
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all<br>
I see them everyday<br>
We get along, so why can't they?<br>
If this is what he wants<br>
And it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?<br>
<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms"><i>[Tom DeLonge:]</i></p>
<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">So here's your holiday<br>
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away<br>
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone<br>
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?<br>
<br>
It's not right<br>
<br>

<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">So here's your holiday<br>

<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Trebuchet ms">It's not right<br>
It's not right<br>
It's not right<br>
It's not right
