<center><h1><p style="font-family:verdana">Story of my life</p></h1></center>

<h1> I am Rick Villanueva and you can call me Rex. In all honesty, my life is like a wheel sometimes going up and sometimes going down. 
Indeed its too cliche but thats the reality in me. My college life, When it comes to working on my assignments, I still prefer to do it alone. 
I do not depend on others. One of my greatest skills is that Im so friendly and when dealing with new people I always used to care with discretion. 
I am a great Gambler too, I know how to play poker, tong-its, three cards and betting on cock fights.</h1>

<h1>Most importantly, In these uncertain times, I am really having a challenging time because I need to do self study. 
It is an imperative duty as a student not to skip classes even though it is an online class. 
In my view online classes are not so effective when it comes to expanding our knowledge. 
In addition to the above-mentioned, my plans soon are to study in a review center and take the licensed customs brokers examination. 
I want to be a passionate customs broker in the future. Also, to help my parents and support them financially. 
Before anything else I need to start doing my job as a student so that my goals in life will be present in the future.</h1>

<h2>THAT WOULD BE ALL...GOD BLESS EVERYONE!!!</h2>
